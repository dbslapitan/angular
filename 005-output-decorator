Pass data from child component to parent component. Can also create custom event.


Passing data from child to parent:

1. At child component declare a property with an output decorator. The variable is an EventEmitter and becomes a property of the component.
2. Bind an event on child component to emit data.
3. On the parent component, add the property to the child component being used, this becomes a custom event.
    ie: courseSelected in <course-card (courseSelected)="<handle event>"></course-card>
4. Create a function to handle the custom event with "$event" parameter. The event parameter is the emitted value.
    ie: onCourseSelected($event)

~~Child Componenent
.ts:
@Output()
  courseSelected = new EventEmitter<Course>();

onViewClick(){
    console.log("View Clicked...");
    this.courseSelected.emit(this.course);
}

.html:
<button (click)="onViewClick()">View Course</button>

~~Parent component
<course-card (courseSelected)="onCourseSelected($event)" [course]="COURSES[0]"></course-card>
