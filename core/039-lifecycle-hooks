OnInit = called once, on initialization, data gets populated.
OnDestroy = called once, when a component gets destroyed. Useful for releasing any resources the component is using like unsubscribing observables.
OnChanges = Triggers one time on intialization and triggers when data changes but not with mutation. Has a changes arguments to see which data changed.

    ngOnChanges(changes){
        console.log(changes);
    }
AfterContentChecked = Triggers every render. Triggers after checking the projections. Great for last modifications of data. Will error out if the modified data is in content projection.
AfterViewChecked = Triggers after content was checked. Last to trigger. Useful for scrolling at the bottom of the page or setting focus.

DoCheck
AfterViewInit = ViewChild or ViewChildren query.
AfterContentInit = ContentChild or ContentChildren query.

Notes:
OnInit, AfterContentInit, and AfterViewInit triggers only once.


Order of trigger:

Initial: 
contructor -> OnChanges -> OnInit -> DoCheck -> AfterContentInit -> AfterContentChecked -> AfterViewInit -> AfterViewChecked 

Everytime change detection run:
OnChanges -> DoCheck -> AfterContentChecked -> AfterViewChecked
