Modules - organizational unit that we can put together components, directives, services amd pipes that are related.

Modules are class with @NgModule Decorator with config.

@NgModule Config:
    declarations - all components, directives and pipes that are part of the module
    imports - dependent modules that the module requires
    providers - for services that the app needs 
        ie. instead of tree-shakable provider or adding it in the component, we can put it in the root module
    bootstrap - identifies the root component of the app
        ie. the app-root element
    export - all components, directives and pipes that we want other module to use


Creating a module steps:

1. scaffold using angular cli: ng g m <Module Name>
2. Move from old declarations to new declarations
3. Import the new module to the old appmodule
