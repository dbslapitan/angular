::ng-deep - bypasses the view encapsulation. It's deprecated and suggested not to be used.

Course Card Component:
<div class="course-card">
    <ng-content select=".course-description"></ng-content>
</div>

Parent Component:
<course-card>
        <div class="course-description">
            {{ course.longDescription }}
        </div>
</course-card>

Since course-description class is a projection, if we select the style inside course-card component, it will not get selected because of the view encapsulation.

This won't work on Course Card Component CSS because of view encapsulation:
.course-card .course-description {
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 15px;
    user-select: none;
}

We can add ::ng-deep before .course-description to bypass this

.course-card ::ng-deep .course-description {
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-top: 15px;
    user-select: none;
}
