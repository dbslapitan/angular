Change Detection Mechanisms:
default: Every expression in the template gets evaluated and triggers a rerender if an expression changes. Events and custom events will trigger a scan.
OnPush: Better performance. Observables expressions and input decorators(not mutations) trigger a rerender. Will also trigger a check on async pipes on the template.
    Ways to trigger rerendering:
        1. Input Decorators
        2. Async pipes


Changing change detection mechanism:
Change the changeDetection property of the config object of @Component Directive to ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush.
