https://v17.angular.io/api/common/NgIf

Previous implementation of @if control flow syntax. Only has else statement and using it is cumbersome. Needs to have ng-template with reference.

<h2 *ngIf="course.id === 2; else noImage">No image available</h2>

<ng-template #noImage>
    <img src="" alt="">
</ng-template>
