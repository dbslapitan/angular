Projected content cannot be querried using ViewChild decorator. It can be querried using @ContentChild decorator and it works like VIewChild but only for projected content.

@ContentChild is used within a component with ng-content in it.

Can also query components if projected content is a component.

Populated on AfterContentInit Lifecycle hook.

parent component:
<course-card>
    <img class="course-image" src="" #imageEl/>
</course-card>

course-card component:

.ts
 @ContentChild('imageEl')
  imageEl: ElementRef;
