Migration from structural directive to control flow structure:

ng generate @angular/core:control-flow

Difference:

@for vs ngFor
    - less verbose
    - @for requires track for better optimization
    - @for doesn't require imports as it is included in the template

@if vs ngIf
    - @if supports @else if and @else
